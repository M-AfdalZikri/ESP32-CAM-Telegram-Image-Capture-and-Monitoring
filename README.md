# ESP32-CAM-Telegram-Image-Capture-and-Monitoring

### ESP32-CAM Device for Scheduled Image Capture and Telegram Notification

The **ESP32-CAM** is an IoT device equipped with a camera that captures images at specified intervals and sends them to a Telegram account. The capture interval is configurable via Telegram, allowing users to set custom times for image capturing.

#### Features:
- **Image Capture**: The ESP32-CAM captures high-quality images at predetermined intervals.
- **Telegram Integration**: The captured images are sent directly to a Telegram chat (which can be a group or a direct message) to ensure timely monitoring.
- **Configurable Time**: The image capture interval is configurable via Telegram commands, allowing users to set the exact time for the ESP32-CAM to take and send pictures.
- **WiFi Connectivity**: The ESP32-CAM connects to WiFi, enabling remote control and communication with Telegram through the internet.
  
#### How it Works:
1. **Telegram Configuration**: Users set up the Telegram bot and integrate it with the ESP32-CAM device.
2. **Set Image Capture Time**: Using specific commands in Telegram, users can set how frequently the ESP32-CAM should take pictures (e.g., every 5 minutes, hourly, or at specific times of day).
3. **Image Capture and Send**: Once the set time arrives, the ESP32-CAM takes a picture and sends it to the designated Telegram chat, allowing the user to monitor the device's environment remotely.
4. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Users can receive images at regular intervals for surveillance, security, or monitoring purposes.

#### Applications:
- **Security Monitoring**: Used to periodically monitor specific areas remotely, with images sent to Telegram for real-time access.
- **Surveillance**: Can be placed in various locations to check on specific activities or environments.
- **Remote Observation**: Ideal for scenarios where the user needs to be remotely updated about a location without continuous human oversight.

#### Example of Use:
- A security team can monitor different locations by setting the ESP32-CAM to take pictures every 15 minutes and send those images to the teamâ€™s Telegram group. The team can then review the images to ensure everything is secure.

With this feature, the ESP32-CAM provides an efficient and convenient way to remotely monitor environments, ensuring that users receive timely updates based on their specific preferences.
